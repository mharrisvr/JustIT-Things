Taking ideas from Screenshot I took of Reddit Post in R/ITCareerQuestions (6/24/2020)

- Install Server OS on Hardare / VM
- Install Active Directory on that server 
- Fill out AD Forestt with characters from the simpsons (Any TV show or anything would work)
- Make Groups for "Power Plant", "Immediate Family", "Extended Family", "School", etc
- Note that many of the characters would overlap and be part of multiple groups
- Create a shared Drive and make folders for each group, give access to each appropritate group, give access for each appropriate folder. 
- Make policy for password resets, password complexity, and requires, etc (Group Policy)
- Make a windows 10 machine adn join in to the Domain. 
- Find the computer object in AD, put it in an OU, make that OU the default for computer objects
- Limit domain joins to domain admins only

- Use a GPO to prevent any user from using removable storage
- Write a powershell script to install updates (Maybe setup WSUS / Update management down the road)
- Write Powershell script to create new user
	- Modify PS script to create a folder location on the shared drive that only the user and domain admin have access to. 
- Use a GPO to block the clearing of the TPM Chip, or to force updates
	- Google "Most Useful GPOs" and deploy some of those. 
- Create 2 more servers to make an ADFS join 
- If access to Win10 Pro on physical machine, create a GPO and powershell script to encrypt it. Save the key in Active Directory.

Personal Things that interest me to setup / play with.. 
	- Look into splunk / tenable
	- Build / stand up proxy server (or reverse proxy).. will need to review and find something free 
	- Integrate Ubuntu into AD and setup 
	- Configuring AD Bitlocker integration
	- Unifi AD Authentication
	- Minecraft server automation (quickly setup, rebuild, etc). 
	- Backups (Possibly VEAMM)?
